# Gravity-Simulation
This is a simple project that simulates 2D gravity with multiple attractors points. When two objects collide they merge into one. I utilized another concept here, know as __*metaballs*__, to draw the objects.

## Objetcs
It contains the __*Astro*__ class, which stores all the vectors, functions etc.

## Orbit
It is the main code.
